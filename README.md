# flour
flour also goes by the name candylibrary, or candylib for short.
Flour serves no purpose except for its basic/compiled "**flourscript**" Based on python's language, just compiled and made for C++/Ruby/Lua.
Flourscript is a basic language, which is really a compiled version of **python**.

# Why?
Flour (CL) is a library built for fun, energetic themed type code, coming with about 20 pre-packed variables for every type of candy/sweet lover out there.
The Flour API Currently only supports python, It is getting support for more languages as time comes.
